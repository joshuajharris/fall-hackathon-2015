					<h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
					<h3>Hackathon's are competitive coding events. Where participants develop from scratch a digital solution 
							to either a societal problem that is presented or for the sake of personal innovation.</h3>
					<h2>Isn't hacking illegal?</h2>
					<h3>We are not using that form of hacking/hacker. We are using it as defined by Wikipedia as, "fun and playful exploratory
							programming." That being said, anyone caught breaking the law (e.g. penetrating a network without permission) will
							be reported to the appropriate authorities.</h3>
					<h2>What is Monarchs Hack the Campus?</h2>
					<h3>Wait...seriously? It's a hackathon.</h3>
					<h2>But what are the challenges then? I'm confused.</h2>
					<h3>Ahhh...some hackathons operate with a central theme and all participants address the same societal issue. 
							But not all. Monarchs Hack the Campus will have multiple themes, each addressing a different topic. These 
							are the challenges. Each will be judged and awarded separately from the other challenges.</h3>
					<h2>Can I participate in multiple challenges?</h2>
					<h3>Sure! Just keep in mind, these will run the gamut and you won't get extra points from the judges for trying to 
							handle multiple challenges. And you will be responsible for presenting to all of the judges in your challenge.</h3>
					<h2>Can I sponsor multiple challenges?</h2>
					<h3>Yes! But, you are responsible for explaining to all hackers what is expected of them, judging and awarding all 
							your challenges.</h3>
					<h2>I don't know how to program, but this sounds like fun!</h2>
					<h3>That's not a question. And you're right they are fun. So you should come. The best way to learn something is to try it.
							And it takes more than programmers to make a good program.</h3>
					<h2>What do you mean "more than programmers"?</h2>
					<h3>You're favourite apps and programs were made by teams of people. Digital artists, marketers, and psychologists. Seriously. 
							It's all about the community.</h3>
					<h2>But I don't have a team/know anyone!<h2>
					<h3>Again, not a question, but all the same. COME. You can use our social media links at the bottom or email us and we will 
							help you meet people. But you can always form a team here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuHfVn_cfHU&t=0m5s" 
							target="_blank" style="border:3px solid black">JUST DO IT!</a> It'll be worth it. Trust us.</h3>
					<h2>What should I bring?</h2>
					<h3>There's a FAQ below for hackers.</h3>
